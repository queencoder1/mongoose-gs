# mongoose-gs
* This lab is going to be relatively simple, since this is all new. We're going to create a recipe ingredients database with Mongoose similar to the SQL database from before.
* Create the mongoose schema and model and add 2 recipes. 
* Write one of each CRUD operation on your database.  
* Comment the code and clearly explain what the script is doing when you get it. Also comment and document everything you add.
* Take some time to poke around outside of these instructions with the database!
* Then push your new script back to GitHub.
